## üéØ Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
The decline in student enrollment in government degree colleges is not due to poor infrastructure or lack of teaching resources. The core issue is a **critical gap in awareness** where students and parents don't understand:
- The importance of graduation
- Career opportunities different degree courses unlock
- How to choose subject streams based on personal interest and future prospects
- Whether pursuing graduation is worth the effort vs. short-term job courses

### Solution Overview
A **web + mobile application** that acts as a **personalized AI career & education advisor** specifically for students in government schools and colleges. The platform helps students make informed academic decisions and increases enrollment in government institutions.

### Target Users
- **Primary:** Class 10 students (choosing streams: Arts, Science, Commerce, or vocational diplomas)
- **Secondary:** Class 12 students (choosing government degree courses: BA, BSc, BCom, BBA, BCA, etc.)
- **Scope:** Government schools, ITIs, Polytechnics, and degree colleges only (private institutions excluded)
